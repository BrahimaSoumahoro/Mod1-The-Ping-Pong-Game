# The Rules of Pong
## The Goal
The only goal of this game is to try and get the ball past your opponent's paddle. The first player to score the Maximum points in a round wins the round and the more round the player wins he wins the game. Each round, the ball will be served by the player who scored last.

## The Players 
In this game the players are comprised of one human versus an Artificial intelligence (A.I) <br>
A.I on the right <br>
Human on the left <br>

## The Game
Every time the human player wins a round the background color will change randomly. If the A.I wins the game is over. <br>
There are 3 match rounds going from the 3 sets to 2 sets the 1 set, the match round gets faster with every human win. 
It is set on auto resting within 2 seconds after a game ends and a winner is declared. 
The reset pong button is just for show.
